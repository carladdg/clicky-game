### Clicky Game: Brooklyn Nine-Nine Edition!

Your favorite detectives from your favorite NYPD precinct are here to test your observation skills.

The rules of the game are simple:
* Twelve pictures of Brooklyn Nine-Nine characters will appear in a random order on your screen. 
* Click on a picture of someone to earn points...
* ...but don't click on a picture you've clicked on before, or you'll lose!
* The pictures will reshuffle after every click, to keep things *interesting*.
